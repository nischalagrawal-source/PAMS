# Auto-Deploy Rule

After ANY code change (file create, edit, delete, or feature modification):

1. Stage all changes: `git add -A`
2. Create a descriptive commit message summarizing what changed
3. Push to the remote: `git push origin main`

This should happen AUTOMATICALLY without asking the user. Every change gets committed and pushed immediately.

The repository is on GitHub and deploys automatically via the hosting platform.
